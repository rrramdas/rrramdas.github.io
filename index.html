Ludwig says:


1.  The world is all that is the case.

2.	What is the case—a fact—is the existence of states of affairs.

3.	A logical picture of facts is a thought.

4.	A thought is a proposition with sense.

5.	A proposition is a truth-function of elementary propositions. (An elementary proposition is a truth function of itself.)

6.	The general form of a truth-function is [p, ξ, N(ξ)].	This is the general form of a proposition.

7.	What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence.
