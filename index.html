Ludwig says: </br>

1.  The world is all that is the case. </br>

2.	What is the case—a fact—is the existence of states of affairs. </br>

3.	A logical picture of facts is a thought. </br>

4.	A thought is a proposition with sense. </br>

5.	A proposition is a truth-function of elementary propositions. (An elementary proposition is a truth function of itself.) </br>

6.	The general form of a truth-function is [p, ξ, N(ξ)].	This is the general form of a proposition. </br>

7.	What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence. </br>
